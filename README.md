## Blog Assignment Overview

- On clicking the button on the left of the navbar, a form will open. This form includes several input fields and a CKEditor to write a blog using markup elements such as `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<strong>`, `<i>`, `<ol>`, `<h1>`, and `<b>`.

- The form includes validation to ensure correct input.

- Upon successful submission of the form, the blog will be reflected below the banner in the blog section.

- None of the blogs that exist by default are hardcoded; all blogs are dynamically rendered from the blog list array.

- State management is handled using `useContext`.

- The entire UI is responsive with appropriate breakpoints.
- - **Third-Party Libraries/Modules used :** The project uses `react-icons` and `ckeditor5` for additional functionality.
