## Blog Assignment Overview

- **Form Interaction:** Clicking the button on the left of the navbar will open a form. This form contains input fields and a CKEditor, allowing you to write a blog using various markups like `ul`, `li`, `strong`, `i`, `ol`, `h1`, and `b`.

- **Form Validation:** The form includes built-in validations to ensure that all required fields are correctly filled out.

- **Blog Submission:** Upon successful submission of the form, the new blog will be dynamically displayed below the banner in the blog section.

- **Dynamic Content:** None of the blogs that appear by default are hardcoded; all blogs are rendered dynamically from the `blogList` array.

- **Responsive UI:** The entire user interface is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices.
